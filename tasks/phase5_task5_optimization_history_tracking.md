**Task:** Implement optimization history tracking.

**Description:**
This task involves creating a system to track the history of the optimizations that have been applied to the code. The system will store information about each optimization, including the date, the changes that were made, and the performance improvements.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- An optimization history tracking system is implemented.
- The system stores the history of all optimizations.
- The system provides an interface for viewing and searching the optimization history.
