**Task:** Build a system for generating test cases.

**Description:**
This task involves creating a system that can automatically generate test cases for the code to be optimized. The generated tests will be used to ensure that the optimizations do not break existing functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system can generate unit tests for a given piece of code.
- The generated tests cover the main functionality of the code.
- The tests can be run automatically to verify the correctness of the code.
