**Task:** Build a pipeline for code transformation.

**Description:**
This task involves creating a pipeline that can apply the suggested optimizations to the code. The pipeline will take the original code and the optimization suggestions as input, and it will produce the optimized code as output.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A code transformation pipeline is created.
- The pipeline can apply the optimizations suggested by the LLM and the rule engine.
- The pipeline ensures that the transformed code is syntactically correct.
