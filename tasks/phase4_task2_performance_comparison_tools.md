**Task:** Implement performance comparison tools.

**Description:**
This task involves creating tools for comparing the performance of the code before and after optimization. The tools will be used to measure the impact of the optimizations and to identify any performance regressions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Performance comparison tools are implemented.
- The tools can compare the execution time, memory usage, and other performance metrics of two versions of the code.
- The tools can generate a report of the performance comparison results.
