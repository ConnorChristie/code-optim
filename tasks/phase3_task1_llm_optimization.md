**Task:** Implement LLM-based code optimization.

**Description:**
This task involves using a large language model (LLM) to suggest and apply code optimizations. The LLM will be given the code and the analysis results, and it will generate optimized versions of the code.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system can send code to an LLM for optimization.
- The LLM returns an optimized version of the code.
- The optimized code is validated to ensure that it is functionally correct.
