**Task:** Establish a basic system for collecting code metrics.

**Description:**
This task involves creating a system to collect various metrics from the code, such as time complexity, space complexity, and resource usage. This information will be used to identify performance bottlenecks.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system can collect metrics from the analysis engine.
- The collected metrics are stored in a time-series database.
- The metrics can be queried and visualized.
