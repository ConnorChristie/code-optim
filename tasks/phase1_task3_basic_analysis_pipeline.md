**Task:** Create a basic pipeline for code analysis.

**Description:**
This task involves setting up a pipeline that can take a repository as input and perform static analysis on the code. The initial focus will be on identifying basic code metrics and patterns.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The pipeline can process a given repository.
- It performs basic static analysis (e.g., counting lines of code, identifying file types).
- The results of the analysis are stored in a structured format.
