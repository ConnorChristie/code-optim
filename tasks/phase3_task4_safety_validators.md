**Task:** Implement safety validators.

**Description:**
This task involves creating a set of validators to ensure that the optimized code is safe and does not introduce any new bugs or vulnerabilities. The validators will check for things like correctness, security, and performance regressions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A set of safety validators is implemented.
- The validators are integrated into the code transformation pipeline.
- The validators can detect and flag potential issues in the optimized code.
