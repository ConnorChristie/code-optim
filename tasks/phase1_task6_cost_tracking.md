**Task:** Implement a system for tracking the costs associated with the optimization process.

**Description:**
This task involves creating a system to monitor and control the costs incurred during the optimization process. This includes tracking LLM token usage, compute resources, and other expenses.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system can track the costs of LLM API calls.
- It can monitor the usage of compute resources.
- The system provides a way to set and enforce budgets.
- Alerts are generated when costs exceed predefined thresholds.
