**Task:** Integrate the Codex CLI for initial codebase understanding.

**Description:**
This task involves integrating the Codex CLI to perform an initial analysis of the codebase. The goal is to leverage the CLI's capabilities to get a high-level understanding of the code, which can then be used to guide the optimization process.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system can invoke the Codex CLI with a given repository.
- The output from the Codex CLI is captured and stored.
- The information from the Codex CLI is used to enrich the code analysis results.
