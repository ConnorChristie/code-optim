**In the next 30 days, we’ll turn the \$2 000 seed into a cash-flow-positive micro-SaaS called “AutoPerf PR Bot.”**
It’s a GitHub App that watches a private repository, pinpoints slow or memory-hungry functions, and opens a pull request with an LLM-generated, benchmark-verified patch. Developers pay a flat monthly fee and GitHub keeps only 5 % of each sale, so we capture generous gross margin. The entire product is digital, requires no shipping address, and can be launched, marketed, and earning its first subscriptions well inside a month.

## 1.  Why this niche makes money quickly

| Signal                                            | Proof                                                                                                          | Why it matters                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Developer tooling is lucrative.**               | GitHub’s platform hit a \$2 B ARR in 2024, driven largely by paid add-ons such as Copilot. ([getlatka.com][1]) | Tens of millions of devs already have payment rails on GitHub; attaching a new tool to that wallet is friction-free. |
| **Performance pain is expensive.**                | 70 % of companies admit they *don’t* know where cloud money is going. ([cloudzero.com][2])                     | If code gets faster, CFOs notice instantly.                                                                          |
| **Technical debt is rampant.**                    | 62 % of engineers say legacy code slows them down. ([stackoverflow.blog][3])                                   | A bot that *eliminates* debt sells itself.                                                                           |
| **LLM-powered code review already excites devs.** | Open-source “PR Review Bot” shows strong community traction. ([github.com][4])                                 | Demonstrates appetite and gives us a head-start codebase.                                                            |
| **Marketplace fees are minimal.**                 | GitHub retains just 5 % of post-2021 sales. ([docs.github.com][5])                                             | Leaves 95 % gross margin.                                                                                            |
| **Micro-SaaS can go profitable fast.**            | One founder hit \$70 k revenue with six days of coding. ([medium.com][6])                                      | Validates the timeline.                                                                                              |
| **AI tools monetize faster than classic SaaS.**   | Median AI start-ups reach \$1 M ARR in 11 months—quicker than 2018 SaaS. ([ft.com][7])                         | Investors and early users expect to pay quickly.                                                                     |

## 2.  Product outline

### Core feature set (v1, ship in 14 days)

1. **Static-plus-runtime analysis** to spot the “hot 5 %” of functions causing 80 % of CPU time.
2. **LLM patch generator** (GPT-4o) suggests micro-optimizations and adds inline benchmarks. OpenAI’s July 2025 price floor (≈ \$0.01 per 1 K tokens) keeps COGS tiny. ([openai.com][8])
3. **Auto-PR workflow**: bot opens a PR, attaches comparison benchmarks, and labels the ticket.
4. **Dashboard & Slack app** for metrics and approvals.

### Why a GitHub App?

* Instant OAuth, billing, and usage metrics via Marketplace APIs. ([docs.github.com][9])
* Flat-rate or per-seat plans allowed; pricing is displayed natively in USD. ([docs.github.com][10])

## 4.  Budget summary (first month)

| Bucket                                  | Amount      |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Cloud hosting & CI/CD                   | **\$200**   |
| OpenAI API credits (200 M tokens)       | **\$400**   |
| Design & brand assets                   | **\$250**   |

| **Cash buffer remaining**               | **\$200**   |

---

## 5.  Revenue projection (conservative)

* **Plan A:** \$49 / mo per private repo, free for open source.
* **Target** 50 paid repos by Day 30 → **MRR \$2 450**.
  *Even if we hit only 20 %, MRR \$490 still > burn.*
* After GitHub’s 5 % fee our gross margin is **95 %**. ([docs.github.com][5])

---

## 6.  Risks & mitigations

| Risk                                       | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LLM hallucination breaks code.**         | Require tests to pass before PR merges; add “benchmarks-must-improve” gate.                                                                                                  |
| **Harder than expected to find hotspots.** | Start with language-specific heuristics (Python cProfile, Go pprof) and expand.                                                                                              |
| **Marketplace review delay.**              | Parallel-launch invite-only SaaS via OAuth until listing is approved.                                                                                                        |
| **Competition from Copilot.**              | Position on *performance & cost savings*, not general code completion. McKinsey pegs productivity upside of AI at \$4.4 T—there’s room for specialists. ([mckinsey.com][14]) |

---

## 7.  Success criteria

* **First paid customer by Day 20**
* **\$2 500 + MRR by Day 30** → break-even cash flow
* **Churn < 5 % in first 90 days**
