# Code Optima: Productization & Packaging Strategy

This document describes how we'll turn the Code Optima optimization engine into a marketable SaaS product, including modular offerings, subscription tiers, pricing models, and go-to-market levers.

## 1. Modular Offerings

Package optimization capabilities into discrete, purchasable modules so customers pay only for the areas they need:

| Module                          | Description                                                      | Relative Cost | Use Cases                            |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------: | ------------------------------------ |
| **Frontend Optimization**       | Asset bundling, lazy loading, DOM batching, critical-path tuning |           Low | Marketing sites, SPAs                |
| **Algorithmic Complexity**      | Hotspot profiling, algorithm refactoring, library swaps          |          High | Data processing pipelines            |
| **DB & Query Optimization**     | Query analysis, index tuning, caching, ORM rewrites              |        Medium | E‑commerce, analytics dashboards     |
| **I/O & Disk Access**           | Batching, async I/O, compression, caching                        |        Medium | File servers, ETL jobs               |
| **Memory & GC Tuning**          | Heap profiling, pooling, in-place updates                        |        Medium | Long‑running services, microservices |
| **Concurrency & Parallelism**   | Thread/task refactoring, event‑loop offloading                   |        Medium | High‑volume backends                 |
| **Energy & Env. Efficiency**    | CPU-cycle reduction, green scheduling, kWh & CO₂ modeling        |           Low | Sustainability-focused businesses    |
| **Security & Compliance**       | Redundant-check pruning, selective validation                    |           Low | Regulated industries                 |
| **Custom Domain Optimizations** | Domain‑specific plugins (graphics, ML, crypto)                   |          High | Game engines, scientific computing   |
| **Continuous Learning**         | Ongoing model & research ingestion                               |           Low | All customers (optional add‑on)      |

## 2. Subscription Tiers

Offer tiered plans that combine modules, SLAs, and support levels:

| Tier             | Included Modules                                 | Monthly Price (USD) | Runs / Month | SLA | Support        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------: | -----------: | --: | -------------- |
| **Starter**      | Frontend; Energy & Env. Efficiency               |                \$99 |           10 | 24h | Community      |
| **Standard**     | + I/O & Disk; DB & Query                         |               \$299 |           50 | 12h | Email          |
| **Professional** | + Memory & GC; Concurrency                       |               \$799 |          200 |  4h | Priority       |
| **Enterprise**   | All Modules + Custom Domain; Continuous Learning |              Custom |    Unlimited |  1h | 24/7 Dedicated |

> **Overage:** \$0.50 per extra run; **Add‑on:** Continuous Learning at \$49/mo
